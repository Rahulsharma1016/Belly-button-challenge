This project creates an interactive dashboard that visualizes bacteria culture data from various samples. 
It uses D3.js to handle data fetching and manipulation, and Plotly.js to create dynamic visualizations, including a Bubble Chart and a Bar Chart. 
Users can select a sample from a dropdown menu to view detailed information about the bacterial composition of each sample.
